1) use input array for visited array => O(1), mark element negative for visited \
precondition : max - min + 1 <= n \
preprocessing : index = arr[i] - min

2) to check if all elment of subarray is consecutive, max-min+1 = subarray_length

3) recursive call stack variable to iterative stack

4) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-any-two-intervals-overlap-among-a-given-set-of-intervals/

idea arr[start]++ and arr[end+1]-- => count overlap , also can count max interval overlap

check physical meaning of it , check-again, think-again
