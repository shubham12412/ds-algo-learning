***How to handle duplicates?*** \
***It doesn’t look possible to search in O(Logn) time in all cases when duplicates are allowed***. For example consider searching 0 in {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2} and {2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}. ***It doesn’t look possible to decide whether to recur for left half or right half by doing constant number of comparisons at the middle.***
