MOâ€™s algorithm is just an order in which we process the queries. We were given M queries, we will re-order the queries in a particular order and then process them. Clearly, this is an offline algorithm. Each query has L and R, we will call them opening and closing. Let us divide the given input array into Sqrt(N) blocks. Each block will be N / Sqrt(N) = Sqrt(N) size. Each opening has to fall in one of these blocks. Each closing has to fall in one of these blocks.
