***A stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added***. In stack both the operations of push and pop takes place at the same end that is top of the stack.

***Stacks are used for maintaining function calls (the last called function must finish execution first)***, we can always remove recursion with the help of stacks. ***Stacks are also used in cases where we have to reverse a word, check for balanced parenthesis and in editors where the word you typed the last is the first to be removed when you use undo operation. Similarly, to implement back functionality in web browsers.***
